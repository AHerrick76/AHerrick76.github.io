To do this, I constructed a dynamic model which simulates thousands of iterated Magic: The Gathering draft tournaments by matching players against each other based on current record. Player skill levels are measured using an elo distribution calibrated on empirical match results, and I analyze the degree of anti-correlation in win rate that results from the implicit skill aggregation of record-based pairing. I compare these results to a static model which does not capture these effects, and discuss in the attached paper.\n","date":"26 March 2022","permalink":"/projects/","section":"Bio","summary":"See below to learn about my recent personal projects -\r\rData Visualization and Dynamic Modeling #\rDynamic Model, Elo Approach to Magic Draft Analysis #\r Paper Text Github Repo  In this project, I investigate the win rate anti-correlation generated by record-based matchmaking in a tournament setting, as opponent skill level reacts in real time to a competitor\u0026rsquo;s current performance.
